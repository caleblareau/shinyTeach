Overview of Shiny apps through two interactive examples. 

## Useful links

There's a ton of information on Shiny out there, but not all of them are worth your time. Here are my recommendations:

- ~1 hour [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ido56dwDTg8) from [Joe Cheng](https://github.com/jcheng5), one of the main developers of Shiny. (Beginner/Intermediate)
- [Advanced Shiny tips](http://deanattali.com/blog/advanced-shiny-tips/) from [Dean Attali](http://deanattali.com/aboutme/), one of the better developers of cool features in Shiny. (Intermediate/Advanced)
- [Shiny gallery](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/) provides all their code along with dozens of sample apps. Sometimes the best way to learn is by example! (Beginner/Intermediate)
- [Plotly gallery](https://plot.ly/r/shiny-gallery/) more examples but rendered through [plotly](https://plot.ly/), which makes the data highly interactive. (Intermediate/Advanced)
- Shameless plugs for two of my mature Shiny apps, an epigenomics browser, [DNAlandscapeR](http://dnalandscaper.aryeelab.org) and [scHemer](https://caleblareau.shinyapps.io/scHemer/)
